# Training an Artificial Neural Network on the MNIST Dataset

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the process of training an artificial neural network (ANN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning, often used as a benchmark to evaluate various machine learning models. The MNIST dataset, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing), provides a robust platform for this purpose. Each image is 28x28 pixels, representing digits from 0 to 9.

The goal is to develop a neural network model that can accurately classify these digits, showcasing the essential concepts of neural network design, training, and evaluation. This project offers an educational walkthrough of creating and training an ANN using TensorFlow and Keras, explaining the code, underlying concepts, and the rationale behind the chosen methods and parameters. The steps include data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and error analysis.

### Step 1 - Import Libraries

The first step in any machine learning project is to import the necessary libraries. These libraries provide the tools needed to handle data, build the model, and visualize results. In this project, the following libraries are used:

1. **NumPy:** For numerical operations and data manipulation.
2. **Matplotlib:** For plotting and visualization.
3. **TensorFlow/Keras:** For building and training the neural network.

Below is the code to import these libraries:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Dropout, BatchNormalization
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
```
--- 

### Step 2 - Load and Preprocess the MNIST Dataset

Loading and preprocessing the data is a critical step in any machine learning project. It ensures that the data is in the right format and scale for the model to learn effectively. Here is the code to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset:

```python
# Load the MNIST dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize the data (scale the pixel values to the range 0 to 1)
X_train = X_train / 255.0
X_test = X_test / 255.0

# Convert labels to categorical one-hot encoding
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)
```

#### Code Review

1. **Loading the MNIST Dataset:**
    ```python
    (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
    ```
    - The `mnist.load_data()` function loads the MNIST dataset, which is split into training and testing sets.
    - `X_train` and `X_test` contain the grayscale images of handwritten digits.
    - `y_train` and `y_test` contain the corresponding labels (digits) for the images.

2. **Understanding the Data:**
    - The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, with 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing.
    - Each image is 28x28 pixels in size, and each pixel value ranges from 0 to 255, representing the intensity of the pixel.

3. **Normalization:**
    ```python
    X_train = X_train / 255.0
    X_test = X_test / 255.0
    ```
    - Normalization is the process of scaling the pixel values to the range [0, 1].
    - This is achieved by dividing each pixel value by 255, which is the maximum possible value for a pixel.
    - Normalizing the data helps in speeding up the convergence of the neural network during training and ensures that the model treats all input values consistently.

4. **One-Hot Encoding:**
    ```python
    y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
    y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)
    ```
    - One-hot encoding is a process that converts categorical labels into a binary matrix representation.
    - In the context of the MNIST dataset, each digit (0-9) is converted into a binary vector of length 10.
    - For example, the digit '3' would be represented as `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
    - This transformation is necessary when using `categorical_crossentropy` as the loss function in training the neural network, as it expects the labels to be in one-hot encoded format.

---

#### [EXTRA] Why One-Hot Encoding?

One-hot encoding is a technique used to convert categorical labels into a binary vector representation. This transformation is crucial for several reasons, particularly when training neural networks with the `categorical_crossentropy` loss function.

1. **Compatibility with Loss Function:**
   - The `categorical_crossentropy` loss function requires the labels to be one-hot encoded. This loss function calculates the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution of the labels. 
   - **Example:**
     - One-hot encoded label: `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`
     - Predicted probabilities: `[0.2, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]`
     - The loss is computed by comparing these two vectors, helping the model understand how far the prediction is from the actual label.

2. **Gradient Calculation and Model Performance:**
   - One-hot encoding ensures that each class is treated independently, which helps in accurately calculating the gradient updates during backpropagation.
   - This detailed gradient information for each class improves the learning process and performance of the model.
   - **Example:**
     - For a classification problem with 3 classes:
       - One-hot target: `[0, 0, 1]`
       - Predicted probabilities: `[0.5, 0.1, 0.4]`
       - The model can adjust its weights more precisely for each class based on the difference between the predicted and actual probabilities.

3. **Avoiding Ordinal Relationships:**
   - One-hot encoding avoids implying any ordinal relationships between the labels. In integer encoding, classes are represented by integers (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...), which might imply an order or ranking.
   - With one-hot encoding, each class is represented by a unique binary vector, eliminating any unintended ordinal implications.
   - **Example:**
     - Integer labels: `2, 1, 0` might imply an order, but with one-hot encoding, `[0, 0, 1]`, `[0, 1, 0]`, `[1, 0, 0]` are just unique vectors with no inherent order.

4. **Memory Efficiency vs. Information Richness:**
   - One-hot encoding is more memory-intensive as it converts each label into a vector. However, it provides richer information about the model's confidence across all classes.
   - **Example:**
     - One-hot encoded label: `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`
     - Predicted probabilities: `[0.2, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]`
     - The model's output shows confidence levels for all classes, which is valuable for understanding and improving the model's predictions.



#### Example Scenario
- **Number of classes (C):** 3
- **True label (one-hot encoded):** $[0, 1, 0]$
- **Predicted probabilities:** $[0.2, 0.7, 0.1]$

##### Formula
The categorical crossentropy loss for a single instance is given by:

$$
\text{Loss} = -\sum_{i=1}^{C} y_i \log(p_i)
$$

Where:
- $y_i$ is the one-hot encoded true label for class $i$.
- $p_i$ is the predicted probability for class $i$.

##### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Identify the true labels ($y_i$):**
   $$
   y = [0, 1, 0]
   $$

2. **Identify the predicted probabilities ($p_i$):**
   $$
   p = [0.2, 0.7, 0.1]
   $$

3. **Calculate the logarithm of each predicted probability $log(p_i)$:**
   $$
   \log(p) = [\log(0.2), \log(0.7), \log(0.1)] \approx [-1.6094, -0.3567, -2.3026]
   $$

4. **Multiply each true label by the corresponding log probability $y_i \log(p_i)$:**
   $$
   y \cdot \log(p) = [0 \cdot (-1.6094), 1 \cdot (-0.3567), 0 \cdot (-2.3026)] = [0, -0.3567, 0]
   $$

5. **Sum the results:**
   $$
   \sum (y \cdot \log(p)) = 0 + (-0.3567) + 0 = -0.3567
   $$

6. **Negate the sum to get the final loss:**
   $$
   \text{Loss} = -(-0.3567) = 0.3567
   $$

> The final value of 0.3567 represents the categorical crossentropy loss for the given example. This loss value quantifies how well the predicted probability distribution matches the actual distribution represented by the true label.

### Step 2.1 - Inspection of the Dataset

Before proceeding to build the neural network model, it is important to understand the characteristics of the dataset and visualize some samples. This helps to get a better sense of the data being worked with.

```python
# Print the shape of the dataset
print(f'Training data shape: {X_train.shape}')
print(f'Training labels shape: {y_train.shape}')
print(f'Test data shape: {X_test.shape}')
print(f'Test labels shape: {y_test.shape}')

# Visualize some examples from the dataset
def plot_sample_images(X, y, num_samples=10):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 1))
    for i in range(num_samples):
        plt.subplot(1, num_samples, i+1)
        plt.imshow(X[i], cmap='gray')
        plt.title(np.argmax(y[i]))
        plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()

plot_sample_images(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Code Review

1. **Print the Shape of the Dataset:**
    ```python
    print(f'Training data shape: {X_train.shape}')
    print(f'Training labels shape: {y_train.shape}')
    print(f'Test data shape: {X_test.shape}')
    print(f'Test labels shape: {y_test.shape}')
    ```
    - **Training Data Shape (`X_train.shape`):**
        - Outputs `(60000, 28, 28)` indicating there are 60,000 training images, each of size 28x28 pixels.
    - **Training Labels Shape (`y_train.shape`):**
        - Outputs `(60000, 10)` indicating there are 60,000 training labels, each one-hot encoded to 10 classes.
    - **Test Data Shape (`X_test.shape`):**
        - Outputs `(10000, 28, 28)` indicating there are 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels.
    - **Test Labels Shape (`y_test.shape`):**
        - Outputs `(10000, 10)` indicating there are 10,000 test labels, each one-hot encoded to 10 classes.
> Understanding the shape and dimensions of the dataset helps in ensuring that the data is correctly loaded and preprocessed.

2. **Visualize Some Examples from the Dataset:**
    ```python
    def plot_sample_images(X, y, num_samples=10):
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 1))
        for i in range(num_samples):
            plt.subplot(1, num_samples, i+1)
            plt.imshow(X[i], cmap='gray')
            plt.title(f'Label:{np.argmax(y[i])}')
            plt.axis('off')
        plt.show()

    plot_sample_images(X_train, y_train)
    ```
    - **Function Definition (`plot_sample_images`):**
        - This function takes the dataset (`X`), labels (`y`), and the number of samples to visualize (`num_samples`).
        - **`plt.figure(figsize=(10, 1))`:** Creates a new figure with a specified size (10 inches wide and 1 inch high).
        - **`for i in range(num_samples)`:** Iterates through the first `num_samples` images in the dataset.
        - **`plt.subplot(1, num_samples, i+1)`:** Creates a subplot in a 1x`num_samples` grid.
        - **`plt.imshow(X[i], cmap='gray')`:** Displays the image at index `i` in grayscale.
        - **`plt.title(np.argmax(y[i]))`:** Sets the title of the subplot to the class label of the image. `np.argmax(y[i])` converts the one-hot encoded label back to its original class label.
        - **`plt.axis('off')`:** Hides the axes for better visualization.
        - **`plt.show()`:** Displays the figure with the plotted images.

### Step 3 - Build the Neural Network Model

Building the neural network model involves defining the architecture, which consists of layers that process the input data to make predictions. Below is the improved code with comments for better readability and understanding.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Dropout, BatchNormalization
from tensorflow.keras.initializers import HeUniform

# Build the model
model = Sequential([
    # Flatten the input image from 28x28 pixels to a 1D vector of 784 elements
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),  
    
    # First hidden layer with 512 neurons, ReLU activation, He Uniform initialization
    Dense(512, activation='relu', kernel_initializer=HeUniform()),
    BatchNormalization(),  # Normalize the activations
    Dropout(0.5),  # Dropout layer for regularization (50% dropout rate)
    
    # Second hidden layer with 256 neurons, ReLU activation, He Uniform initialization
    Dense(256, activation='relu', kernel_initializer=HeUniform()),
    BatchNormalization(),  # Normalize the activations
    Dropout(0.4),  # Dropout layer for regularization (40% dropout rate)
    
    # Third hidden layer with 128 neurons, ReLU activation, He Uniform initialization
    Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_initializer=HeUniform()),
    BatchNormalization(),  # Normalize the activations
    Dropout(0.3),  # Dropout layer for regularization (30% dropout rate)
    
    # Output layer with 10 neurons (one for each class) and softmax activation

---

### Step 4 - Compile the Model

After defining the model architecture, the next step is to compile the model. Compiling the model involves configuring the learning process by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. Below is the code to compile the model along with explanations and comments for better understanding.

```python
# Compile the model
model.compile(
    optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),  # Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',      # Loss function for multi-class classification
    metrics=['accuracy']                  # Evaluation metric to monitor during training and testing
)
```

#### Code Review

1. **Optimizer:**
    - `optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001)`: 
      - The Adam optimizer is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent, namely AdaGrad and RMSProp.
      - It computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter. Here, the initial learning rate is set to 0.001.

2. **Loss Function:**
    - `loss='categorical_crossentropy'`:
      - The categorical crossentropy loss function is used for multi-class classification problems.
      - It measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution of the labels.
      - It expects the labels to be in one-hot encoded format.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
    - `metrics=['accuracy']`:
      - Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric to monitor the performance of the model during training and testing.
      - It measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.

> Compiling the model is a crucial step that configures the learning process by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. This setup ensures that the model is ready for training with the appropriate learning configuration.

---

### Step 5 - Train the Model

Training the model involves feeding the training data into the model, allowing it to learn the patterns and relationships within the data. During training, the model's weights are updated iteratively to minimize the loss function. Below is the code to train the model along with explanations and comments for better understanding.

```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,            # Training data and labels
    epochs=10,                   # Number of epochs
    batch_size=32,               # Batch size
    validation_split=0.2,        # Split 20% of the training data for validation
    verbose=2                    # Verbose output to show progress
)
```

#### Code Review

1. **Training Data and Labels:**
   - `X_train, y_train`:
     - The training data (`X_train`) consists of the normalized images.
     - The training labels (`y_train`) are the one-hot encoded labels.

2. **Number of Epochs:**
   - `epochs=10`:
     - An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset.
     - Here, the model will be trained for 10 epochs, meaning the entire dataset will be passed through the model 10 times.

3. **Batch Size:**
   - `batch_size=32`:
     - The batch size defines the number of samples that will be propagated through the network at a time.
     - Here, the model will use a batch size of 32, meaning it will update the weights after processing every 32 samples.

4. **Validation Split:**
   - `validation_split=0.2`:
     - This parameter specifies the fraction of the training data to be used as validation data.
     - Here, 20% of the training data will be set aside for validation, and the remaining 80% will be used for training.

5. **Verbose Output:**
   - `verbose=2`:
     - The verbose parameter controls the verbosity of the training process.
     - `verbose=2` provides a more detailed output for each epoch, including loss and accuracy metrics for both training and validation data.

### Training Process:

During the training process, the model iteratively updates its weights to minimize the loss function. The `fit` function returns a `history` object that contains the training and validation loss and accuracy for each epoch. This history can be used to visualize the training progress and evaluate the model's performance.

#### Example Output

The output during training will look something like this:

```plaintext
Epoch 1/10
1500/1500 - 8s - loss: 0.2854 - accuracy: 0.9142 - val_loss: 0.0876 - val_accuracy: 0.9745
Epoch 2/10
1500/1500 - 7s - loss: 0.1158 - accuracy: 0.9652 - val_loss: 0.0663 - val_accuracy: 0.9798
...
Epoch 10/10
1500/1500 - 7s - loss: 0.0552 - accuracy: 0.9824 - val_loss: 0.0406 - val_accuracy: 0.9870
```

- **Epoch 1/10:** The first epoch, showing the training and validation loss and accuracy.
- **Epoch 2/10:** The second epoch, showing improved metrics.
- ...
- **Epoch 10/10:** The final epoch, showing further improvement in metrics.

### Summary of Step 5:

> Training the model is a critical step where the neural network learns from the data by adjusting its weights to minimize the loss function. This step includes specifying the number of epochs, batch size, and validation split to ensure effective training and validation.

---

### Step 6 - Evaluate the Model

After training the model, it is essential to evaluate its performance on unseen test data. This step involves using the test dataset to measure the model's accuracy and loss, providing an indication of how well the model generalizes to new data.

Below is the code to evaluate the model along with explanations and comments for better understanding.

```python
# Evaluate the model on the test data
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=1)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}')
```

#### Code Review

1. **Evaluate the Model:**
   ```python
   test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=1)
   ```
   - The `evaluate` method is used to assess the model's performance on the test dataset.
   - `X_test` and `y_test` are the normalized images and their corresponding one-hot encoded labels from the test set.
   - `verbose=1` provides progress output during the evaluation process.
   - The method returns the test loss and test accuracy, which are stored in the variables `test_loss` and `test_acc`.

2. **Print the Test Accuracy:**
   ```python
   print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}')
   ```
   - This code line prints the accuracy of the model on the test data, providing a measure of how well the model performs on new, unseen data.

#### Example Output

The output might look something like this:

```plaintext
313/313 [==============================] - 2s 6ms/step - loss: 0.0352 - accuracy: 0.9876
Test accuracy: 0.9876
```

- **313/313:** Indicates that the evaluation ran through all 313 batches of the test dataset.
- **2s 6ms/step:** Indicates the time taken per step during the evaluation.
- **loss: 0.0352:** The loss of the model on the test data.
- **accuracy: 0.9876:** The accuracy of the model on the test data, indicating that the model correctly classified 98.76% of the test images.


> Evaluating the model on the test data is a crucial step to understand the model's generalization capability. The evaluation provides metrics such as loss and accuracy, which help in assessing the model's performance on new, unseen data. This step ensures that the model is not only performing well on the training data but also effectively generalizes to real-world data.

### Step 7 - Generate Predictions and Analyze Misclassifications

After evaluating the model, the next step is to use the trained model to generate predictions on the test dataset and analyze the misclassified instances. This step helps in understanding the model's performance and identifying areas for potential improvement.

```python
# Generate predictions for the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
y_true_classes = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)

# Find the indices of the misclassified instances
misclassified_indices = np.where(y_pred_classes != y_true_classes)[0]

# Display some misclassified images
num_misclassified_to_show = 10  # Number of misclassified images to display
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
for i, index in enumerate(misclassified_indices[:num_misclassified_to_show]):
    plt.subplot(5, 2, i + 1)
    plt.imshow(X_test[index], cmap='gray')
    plt.title(f"True: {y_true_classes[index]}, Pred: {y_pred_classes[index]}")
    plt.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### Code Review

1. **Generate Predictions:**
   ```python
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```
   - The `predict` method generates the predicted probabilities for each class for all the test samples.

2. **Convert Predictions to Class Labels:**
   ```python
   y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
   y_true_classes = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)
   ```
   - `np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)` converts the predicted probabilities into class labels by taking the index of the highest probability for each sample.
   - Similarly, `np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)` converts the one-hot encoded true labels back to their original class labels.

3. **Identify Misclassified Instances:**
   ```python
   misclassified_indices = np.where(y_pred_classes != y_true_classes)[0]
   ```
   - `np.where(y_pred_classes != y_true_classes)[0]` finds the indices where the predicted class labels do not match the true class labels.

4. **Visualize Misclassified Images:**
   ```python
   num_misclassified_to_show = 10  # Number of misclassified images to display
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
   for i, index in enumerate(misclassified_indices[:num_misclassified_to_show]):
       plt.subplot(5, 2, i + 1)
       plt.imshow(X_test[index], cmap='gray')
       plt.title(f"True: {y_true_classes[index]}, Pred: {y_pred_classes[index]}")
       plt.axis('off')
   plt.tight_layout()
   plt.show()
   ```
   - The code plots a specified number of misclassified images along with their true and predicted labels.
   - `plt.imshow(X_test[index], cmap='gray')` displays the misclassified image in grayscale.
   - `plt.title(f"True: {y_true_classes[index]}, Pred: {y_pred_classes[index]}")` sets the title of the subplot to show the true and predicted labels.
   - `plt.axis('off')` hides the axis for better visualization.

### Example Output:

The output will display the specified number of misclassified images with their true and predicted labels.
